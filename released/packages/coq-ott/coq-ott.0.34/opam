synopsis: "Auxiliary Coq library for Ott, a tool for writing definitions of programming languages and calculi"
description: """
Ott takes as input a definition of a language syntax and semantics, in a concise
and readable ASCII notation that is close to what one would write in informal
mathematics. It can then generate a Coq version of the definition, which requires
this library.
