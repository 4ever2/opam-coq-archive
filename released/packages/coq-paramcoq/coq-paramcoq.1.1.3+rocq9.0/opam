synopsis: "Plugin for generating parametricity statements to perform refinement proofs"
description: """
/!\ Paramcoq is no longer actually maintained and released. It is only
kept as a test case for Rocq's OCaml API. The release for Rocq 9.0
will be the last one and is known to suffer some universe issues
(for instance iit no longer enable to compile CoqEAL). Users are
invited to switch to [coq-elpi](https://github.com/LPCIC/coq-elpi)
derive.param2. One can look at
[CoqEAL](https://github.com/coq-community/coqeal) for an example of
porting. Main current caveat: support for mutual inductives isn't
implemented yet.

A Rocq plugin providing commands for generating parametricity statements.
Typical applications of such statements are in data refinement proofs.
Note that the plugin is still in an experimental state - it is not very user
friendly (lack of good error messages) and still contains bugs. But it
is usable enough to "translate" a large chunk of the standard library."""
